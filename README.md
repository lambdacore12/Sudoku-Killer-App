# Sudoku Killer App

This app allows you to get the possible combinations of numbers for a target number of your choice.

You give a target number (7 for example) and it gives you the possible combinations (1 + 6 / 2 + 5 / 3 + 4)

Future plans:
1- Make window always on top
2- Ability to change color of combination(s) to rule it out when playing

If you've played Killer Sudoku before, you know this is helpful.
